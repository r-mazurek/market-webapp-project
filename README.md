## Market App Web Application Project

This project is a market monitoring tool with a modern, responsive design. The app provides users with daily market information, countdowns to trading session start/end times, and presents the daily price change of key indexes.

## Project Overview

The Market App leverages Flask for server-side processing and provides a dark-themed, mobile-friendly UI designed with the Bulma CSS framework. It displays market conditions, dynamically adjusts trading session countdowns, and visually indicates price changes with icons and color changes. It demonstrates a practical approach to presenting data on a web interface. Its usecase is directly correlated with my own interest in the financial markets.

## Features

* Dynamic Market Information: Updates on market conditions and price changes for key indices, presented in an intuitive and engaging format.
* Session Countdown: Displays the time remaining until the trading session starts or ends.
* Holiday-Aware Design: The app detects holidays and informs the user that the market will be closed.
* Responsive Design: Built with Bulma CSS to ensure a modern look across desktop and mobile devices.
* Dark Theme: Provides a user-friendly, visually appealing dark mode.
* Dynamic Icons: Uses Font Awesome icons to indicate positive and negative market trends, type of day and time till open/close to make the information easier to follow.
